# Chess Program - Atharva Washimkar

This is a basic chess application made by me for fun (and because I really like chess) :) The application allows users to play a game of chess against another person, or against a basic chess engine that I coded to go with the program.

The program has a Java Swing-based custom GUI (with custom Look and Feel) modelling Google's Material Design UI - something which I think is aesthetically appealing and could be reused in future projects.

The program's engine is not very strong, although it can put up a fight :)

NOTE: Some parts of the application are unfinished, with some functionality such as opening and saving .pgn files (a way to store chess games on disk, for use outside the program).

However, ALL features which are related to actually playing the game exist. In short, it's a good way to waste a few hours :)
