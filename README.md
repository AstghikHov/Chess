# Chess

This is a basic chess application made by Atharva Washimkar for fun :) The application allows users to play a game of chess against another person, or
against a very basic chess engine that I coded to go with the program.

The program also has a Java Swing-based custom GUI (with custom Look and Feel) modelling Google's Material Design UI - something which
I think is aesthetically appealing and could be reused in future projects.

NOTE: The application is unfinished, with some functionality such as opening and saving .pgn files (a way to store chess games on disk, for use outside the program).
However, ALL gameplay related features exist, in terms of the actual game. In short, it's a good way to waste a few hours :)
